# Instructions for use
- These codes can simulate AE events and calculate the moment tensor of each AE event in Itasca PFC5.0 software and need to run on PFC5.0 version which supports IPython QT console.  
- 2D simulation and 3D simulation are code files used in PFC2D 5.0 and PFC3D 5.0 respectively.  
- Codes in main2D.p2dat and main3D.p3dat need to be copied to the main program before the statement that executes the cycle calculation.
